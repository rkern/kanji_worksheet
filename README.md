# Kanji Worksheet

Simple tool for working with the 
[NihongoShark.com Kanji Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956) of
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards for learning Japanese kanji. In
particular, it examines the last day's worth of cards that you reviewed and
makes a printable HTML for writing practice.

I've semi-hardcoded things such that it works on my macOS machine with my Anki
username, so fork and fix to taste. I'm not much interested in making
a hardened, easy-to-install application for everyone.
